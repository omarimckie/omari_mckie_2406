15. Describe why the company needs it and why the company would be better off after it is in place.

- We will have a combination of a Transaction Processing System (TPS) and a Communication and Collaboration System (CCS). TPS because it captures and
processes data about business transactions such as the selling of the sneakers as well as the customization options. CCS because there will have to be
communication to achieve the level of collaboration needed to customize shoes as well as pair ppls rare shoes that they are looking to sell with those 
collectors that are looking to buy.
