preexisting situation, list at least five problems with the current state of affairs that would be solved or improved
by the proposed system.

- Customers cant customize orders online
- We cant match customers that want to sell their sneakers to ones that want to buy them
- We can only reach customers that physically come into the store
- Our databases between our 6 locations arent linked
- Dont have a loyalty program that allows us to keep our customers 

20. For each problem, provide a system improvement objective that would be accomplished and that would be
measurable in some objective way. Refer to our text for discussion of what good examples of system
improvement objectives are
