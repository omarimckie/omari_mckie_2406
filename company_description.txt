A sneaker store that carries inventory you are looking for but will also pair clients up with rare/any sneakers that they are looking for.

1. What's the company's name? 

Kicks Universal


2. How many locations do they have?

6 locations, (NYC, Atlanta, Chicago, LA, Tokyo, London)


3. How many employees comprise the entire organization?

26 employees


4. Provide the logic you used to estimate the total number of employees.

- 4 per locations (1 register, 2 floor ppl, 1 backroom ppl)
- 2 to maintain database and do research


5. What do they sell or how do they generate revenue?

- sell regular sneakers
- sell customized sneakers
- find rare sneakers (finders fee on top of cost of shoes) - finders fee is probably similar to cosignment
 

6. Give an estimate of their gross annual revenue.

- there is about on average a 45% markup on sneakers. 
- 240 regular sneakers sold per day ~ $100 per sneaker = $24k in regular sneaker sales/day * 55% actual revenue = $13,200/day for all locations
- believe that 10% of our sneaker sales will be custom sneakers, which would mean that ~ 26.666 would be custom, which we will round to 27
	- will have 2 tiers of customization, 
		- 1st tier - change color scheme - additional $70 on top of shoe. 
		- 2nd tier - change color scheme with any additional graphics/patterns - additional $140 on top of shoe 
	- 27 custom sneakers sold per day ~ $100 per sneaker = $2,700 * 55% actual revenue = $1,485 of base shoe
					- ~ $105 customization =  $2,835 customization revenue + $1,485 = $4,320 profit on shoe for all locations
- pair seekers for rare shoes with sellers, will charge a 20% consignment/finders fee
	- 10 sneakers/day * ~ $400/sneaker = $4,000 * 20% = $800

- 4 low level employees * $2000/month = $8000/month * 12 months = $96,000/yr
- 2 ppl to maintain database * $5,500/month = $11,000/month * 12 months = $132,000/yr
- rent for properties ~ $3000/month * 12 months * 6 locations = $216,000/yr

- add up revenue streams = $13,200 + $4,320 + $800 = $18,320/day * 365 days/yr = $6,686,800/yr
- minus the liabilities = $96,000/yr + $132,000/yr + $216,000/yr = 		 $444,000/yr
										 $6,242,800 GROSS PROFIT


7. Every company has some notion of a transaction, i.e. some set of operations that constitute the
accomplishment of an objective or task in a software system. Examples of such transactions that drive a
company's business operations are the sale of a retail item, an event ticket sale, a trouble ticket for technical
support, a service of some kind like a trip by taxi or a lesson, a book loan, etc. This notion of transaction will
permeate your design project, so clarify how it applies to your company. What are the information system
transactions that drive your company's operations? 

- selling sneakers
- customization of sneakers
- finders fee to sell shoes to ppl looking for rare shoes

- We will have a combination of a Transaction Processing System (TPS) and a Communication and Collaboration System (CCS). TPS because it captures and
processes data about business transactions such as the selling of the sneakers as well as the customization options. CCS because there will have to be
communication to achieve the level of collaboration needed to customize shoes as well as pair ppls rare shoes that they are looking to sell with those 
collectors that are looking to buy. 



8. How many of each type of transaction occurs per day?

- per location 40 sneakers/day x 6 = 240 sneakers



9. Provide the logic behind your estimate of the number of transactions.

10% of our sneaker sales will be custom sneakers, 
- pair seekers for rare shoes with sellers, will charge a 20% consignment/finders fee
	- 10 sneakers/day 
  
- the way that 240 was estimated was that 
	- 6 stores worldwide so thats 40 per store
	- our store will be open 10 hrs/day 10am - 8 pm.
	- 40 per store at 10/hrs per day is 4/hr


10. What is the throughput of your system in bytes per second?

- we will be using Vector graphics most likely for the website. we need high fidelity on the images of these sneakers that we are selling, especially
when it comes to the customizations and the resale of others shoes. 
- there will be multiple high pixel count images on a page at a time. 
- estimate that we will need 1024 x 960 images @ 5 bytes per pixel ~ 3MB / sec


11. Provide the logic behind your estimate of throughput.

- estimate that we will need 1024 x 960 images @ 5 bytes per pixel ~ 3MB / sec

12. A client is someone who seeks your company's services. You are in business to serve your clients. Identify
who the clients are of your company's business?

- anyone that wants to buy sneakers


13. A supplier is a person or organization that your company relies on to do business. Who are your company's
