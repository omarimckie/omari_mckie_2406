37. Provided a complete description of how the finished product is meant to be used in terms of its functional
requirements.

- our product is meant to be a business that has a website that is an extension of our physical locations. The way that it will be used is similar to
  our physical store in the fact that you will have the full selection of our sneakers to buy. That is really where the comparisons end. With our online 
  presence, you will be able to set up a profile that you will be able to manage from your personal computer. There is where you will be able to track 
  orders as well as see past orders. Along with that, you will be able to pick any of the active sneakers and customize it on the fly. We will have 
  many tools available so that customers will be able to customize the sneaker to whatever they like. Lastly on the client-side, the customer will be able
  to view an active database of sneakers that collectors/opportunist are trying to sell. On our side of the application, we will dynamically track inventory
  to maintain an appropriate level. When the level dips below a certain amount, we will have a system that is able to automatically order more inventory.
  We will have a chat feature that will allow us to alleviate our customers concerns as far as orders, website glitches, or anything else that may be 
  troubling them. Lastly, we will be able to print out Financial Statements, Sales Reports and any other type of report that would help the owners make
  decisions for the business going forwards.
